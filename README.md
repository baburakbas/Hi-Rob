# Hi-Rob

// Hi-Rob motor control mechanism code for Arduino test system. 
 // In system L298N model DC motor driver's pins are trigered by Arduino outputs 
 
 // For speed control PWM signal has been used
 // PWM duty cycle frequency setting by enA-enB pins, 0-255 values 
 // PWM output values has best efficiency for 100 
 
 // Control GROUND connections for every test. Arduino and L298N should be short-circuit
